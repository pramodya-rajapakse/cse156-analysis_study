The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.\",\n          \"Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group). Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a parliamentary speaker (Rifaat al-Mahgoub), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police. Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya), renounced violence in 2003. Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, Salvation from Hell and Takfir wal-Hijra, and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.\",\n          \"The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11864,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Specific relativity offers an equivalence between what?\",\n          \"In the mid 18th century, who did not concur that 1 should be the first prime number?\",\n          \"The residual of what can be seen in front of hadrons?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5837,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"{'text': array(['Himalayan glaciers', 'Himalayan glaciers'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([417, 417], dtype=int32)}\",\n          \"{'text': array(['yes or no', 'yes or no', 'yes or no'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([179, 179, 179], dtype=int32)}\",\n          \"{'text': array(['at the end of the 19th century', 'end of the 19th century',\\n       'end of the 19th century', 'end of the 19th century',\\n       'end of the 19th century'], dtype=object), 'answer_start': array([352, 359, 359, 359, 359], dtype=int32)}\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5245,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" late 1980s\",\n          \" ~3000 yr BP\",\n          \" Christchurch\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":30}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# clean up answers columns -> convert back to list of strings, clean up whitespace in predictions\n","for index, row in squad_v2_df.iterrows():\n","  text = row['answers']\n","\n","  # remove all extra characters\n","  text = text.replace(\"\\n\", \"\")\n","  text = text.replace('\"', '')\n","  text = text.replace(\"'\", '')\n","\n","  # get list of answers as a string\n","  start = text.index('[')\n","  end = text.index(']')\n","  list_string = text[start:end+1]\n","\n","  # convert to actual list\n","  actual_list = list_string.strip(\"[]\").split(', ')\n","  actual_list = [answer.strip() for answer in actual_list] # remove leading/trailing whitespace\n","  row['answers'] = actual_list\n","\n","  # clean whitespace off of predictions\n","  if isinstance(row['prediction'], str):\n","    row['prediction'] = row['prediction'].strip()"],"metadata":{"id":"1oOdCp_EZ_rU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717529288091,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":1274,"user":{"displayName":"Pramodya Rajapakse","userId":"09056444407191441792"}}},"execution_count":31,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["squad_v2_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":597},"id":"3hWdqV5PabtY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1717529290828,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":329,"user":{"displayName":"Pramodya Rajapakse","userId":"09056444407191441792"}},"outputId":"eec53d80-7f73-47e6-a6ef-5c0befb3479b"},"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                             id                  title  \\\n","0      570d2417fed7b91900d45c3e   Victoria_(Australia)   \n","1      572864542ca10214002da2e1  University_of_Chicago   \n","2      5ad15289645df0001a2d175d     European_Union_law   \n","3      5a668fc9f038b7001ab0bfe6       Packet_switching   \n","4      5730035e04bcaa1900d77004               Islamism   \n","...                         ...                    ...   \n","11868  57264cfa708984140094c1c5             Ctenophora   \n","11869  5a82370631013a001a3352e2     Harvard_University   \n","11870  5ad4a75aba00c4001a268eea          Immune_system   \n","11871  57378b141c4567190057449f                  Force   \n","11872  5728848cff5b5019007da29b           Yuan_dynasty   \n","\n","                                                 context  \\\n","0      The economy of Victoria is highly diversified:...   \n","1      The Maroons compete in the NCAA's Division III...   \n","2      Free movement of goods within the European Uni...   \n","3      Merit Network, Inc., an independent non-profit...   \n","4      Roughly contemporaneous with Maududi was the f...   \n","...                                                  ...   \n","11868  The outer surface bears usually eight comb row...   \n","11869  Harvard operates several arts, cultural, and s...   \n","11870  Microorganisms or toxins that successfully ent...   \n","11871  Since then, and so far, general relativity has...   \n","11872  The historian Frederick W.

The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages.\",\n          \"Another of the Egyptian groups which employed violence in their struggle for Islamic order was al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group). Victims of their campaign against the Egyptian state in the 1990s included the head of the counter-terrorism police (Major General Raouf Khayrat), a parliamentary speaker (Rifaat al-Mahgoub), dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over 100 Egyptian police. Ultimately the campaign to overthrow the government was unsuccessful, and the major jihadi group, Jamaa Islamiya (or al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya), renounced violence in 2003. Other lesser known groups include the Islamic Liberation Party, Salvation from Hell and Takfir wal-Hijra, and these groups have variously been involved in activities such as attempted assassinations of political figures, arson of video shops and attempted takeovers of government buildings.\",\n          \"The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses. Therefore, pathogens evolved several methods that allow them to successfully infect a host, while evading detection or destruction by the immune system. Bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier, for example, by using a type II secretion system. Alternatively, using a type III secretion system, they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell, providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host. These proteins are often used to shut down host defenses.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"question\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11864,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Specific relativity offers an equivalence between what?\",\n          \"In the mid 18th century, who did not concur that 1 should be the first prime number?\",\n          \"The residual of what can be seen in front of hadrons?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prediction\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5206,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"defensins\",\n          \"design-build, partnering and construction management\",\n          \"What was suggested at the Symposium in 1967Starting in 1965, Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory, UK, independently developed the same message routing methodology as developed by Baran. He called it packet switching, a more accessible name than Baran's, and proposed to build a nationwide network in the UK. He gave a talk on the proposal in 1966, after which a person from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) told him about Baran's work.

Newton, however, realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion, his law of gravity had to be universal.

Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \\\"inconvenience\\\" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.\",\n          \"The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.\",\n          \"There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. Black's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \\\"carefully chosen and legitimate means,\\\" but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the \\\"inconvenience\\\" of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe. However, this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit ratios, and an individual's overall suitability for use of a medication. There also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products.\",\n          \"The final major evolution of the steam engine design was the use of steam turbines starting in the late part of the 19th century. Steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines (for outputs above several hundred horsepower), have fewer moving parts, and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means. Steam turbines virtually replaced reciprocating engines in electricity generating stations early in the 20th century, where their efficiency, higher speed appropriate to generator service, and smooth rotation were advantages. Today most electric power is provided by steam turbines. In the United States 90% of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources. Steam turbines were extensively applied for propulsion of large ships throughout most of the 20th century.\",\n          \"There have been debates as to whether civil disobedience must necessarily be non-violent. Black's Law Dictionary includes non-violence in its definition of civil disobedience. Christian Bay's encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \\\"carefully chosen and legitimate means,\\\" but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society's tolerance of civil disobedience.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

Some European nations and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from United States foreign policy in the Middle East to avoid being targeted by the boycott. Arab oil producers linked any future policy changes to peace between the belligerents. To address this, the Nixon Administration began multilateral negotiations with the combatants. They arranged for Israel to pull back from the Sinai Peninsula and the Golan Heights. By January 18, 1974, US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai Peninsula. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was enough to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974.\",\n          \"An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education. Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages.

Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there. The Normans were now free to penetrate into the hinterland; they took Ioannina and some minor cities in southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly before appearing at the gates of Thessalonica. Dissension among the high ranks coerced the Normans to retreat to Italy. They lost Dyrrachium, Valona, and Butrint in 1085, after the death of Robert.\",\n          \"Jacksonville, like most large cities in the United States, suffered from negative effects of rapid urban sprawl after World War II. The construction of highways led residents to move to newer housing in the suburbs. After World War II, the government of the city of Jacksonville began to increase spending to fund new public building projects in the boom that occurred after the war. Mayor W. Haydon Burns' Jacksonville Story resulted in the construction of a new city hall, civic auditorium, public library and other projects that created a dynamic sense of civic pride. However, the development of suburbs and a subsequent wave of middle class \\\"white flight\\\" left Jacksonville with a much poorer population than before. The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, declined from 75.8% in 1970 to 55.1% by 2010.\",\n          \"Some theories of civil disobedience hold that civil disobedience is only justified against governmental entities. Brownlee argues that disobedience in opposition to the decisions of non-governmental agencies such as trade unions, banks, and private universities can be justified if it reflects \\\"a larger challenge to the legal system that permits those decisions to be taken\\\". The same principle, she argues, applies to breaches of law in protest against international organizations and foreign governments.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
